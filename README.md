# Emotion Classification
 Bachelor Thesis
 
The problem of recognition of facial expressions is still an ongoing research, and it relies on advancements in Image Processing and Computer Vision techniques. Such
systems have a variety of interesting applications, from human-computer interaction, to robotics and computer animations. Their aim is to provide robustness and high
accuracy, but also to cope with variability in the environment and adapt to real time scenarios. This project is a facial expression recognition system, capable of
distinguishing the six emotions: disgust, anger, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise. It is designed to be person independent and tailored only for static images. The
system integrates a face detection mechanism using Viola-Jones algorithm, uses uniform Local Binary Patterns for feature extraction and performs classification
using a multi-class Support Vector Machine model.
